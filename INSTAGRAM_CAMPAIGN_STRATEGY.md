### Post 1: Studio Introduction
**Caption:**
```
Welcome to where the ocean meets movement 🌊✨

I'm Noël, and I created Pilates by the Sea to offer something special -
classical Pilates training in an oceanfront sanctuary.

With 700 hours of certification and a background in dance and education,
I bring both precision and passion to every private session.

Whether you're recovering from injury, looking to build strength, or
simply seeking a mindful movement practice - I'd love to work with you.

### Post 2: Educational Content
**Caption:**
```
3 signs your core isn't as strong as you think 👇

❌ Your lower back arches during planks
❌ You hold your breath during exercises
❌ You feel your neck/shoulders more than your core

True core strength isn't about six-pack abs - it's about deep,
functional stability that supports every movement you make.

In our private sessions, we focus on:
✨ Engaging the deep core muscles (not just surface abs)
✨ Proper breathing patterns
✨ Alignment that protects your spine
✨ Functional strength for daily life

### Post 3: Client Testimonial
**Caption:**
```
"I've tried gyms, yoga, and physical therapy... but nothing helped my
chronic back pain like Pilates with Noël. The personalized attention
and her deep knowledge of the body made all the difference."
- Jennifer, 48

This is what private sessions are all about 💙

When you work one-on-one, every movement is tailored to YOUR body,
YOUR history, and YOUR goals. No cookie-cutter classes. Just you,
the equipment, and my full attention.

If you've been dealing with pain, stiffness, or just want to feel
stronger and more aligned - let's talk.

### Post 5: Behind the Scenes
**Caption:**
```
The quiet before the day begins ☕🌅

Every morning, I arrive before my first client to set up the studio,
watch the ocean wake up, and ground myself in gratitude.

This space isn't just a studio to me - it's a sanctuary. A place where
bodies heal, strength builds, and people remember what it feels like
to move with ease.

The ocean reminds me why we're here: to flow, to be strong yet flexible,
to move with the rhythm of life rather than against it.

- Use video (Reels are prioritized by algorithm)

### Don'ts ❌

- Don't post and ghost (engage after posting!)
- Don't use the same hashtags every time
- Don't over-edit photos (keep it real)
- Don't compare your beginning to someone else's middle
- Don't ignore comments and DMs
- Don't post without a call to action

## 📞 Converting Engagement to Bookings

### DM Response Templates

**When someone asks about pricing:**
```
Hi [name]! Private sessions are $65 for 50 minutes of personalized
classical Pilates instruction in our oceanfront studio.

For first-time clients, we start with an assessment to understand
your goals and any limitations, then create a tailored practice.

I have [day/time] available this week - would that work for you?
Or I can send you my booking calendar: [link]
```

**When someone asks "what's Pilates?":**
```
Great question! Classical Pilates is a full-body strengthening system
that builds core stability, improves posture, and increases flexibility
through precise, controlled movements.

It's lower impact than traditional gym workouts but incredibly effective
for building functional strength. Perfect for all ages and fitness levels!

Have you worked out before or would this be starting something new?
```

**When someone shows interest but doesn't book:**
```
I'd love to have you in the studio! The oceanfront setting really does
make the experience special 🌊

No pressure at all - would it be helpful if I sent you some info about
what to expect in a first session? Or if you have any questions, I'm
happy to answer them!
```

### Story CTA Strategies

**Swipe-up links (if you have 10k+ followers):**
- Link directly to calendar
- Link to pricing page

**Without swipe-up:**
- "Link in bio to book"
